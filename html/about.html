            <p>
                I am Joachim Jacobs. A student at Thomas More: de nayer, following the course ICT: application development. I am intrested in programming. Making applications with my own logic and code. I am also a gamer. One of the reasons I like programming is because
                I can make my own things. Like a game for example.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't have a job at the moment but I would like one in the ICT domain. I am really looking forward to actually working.
            </p>

                I now am just a hobbist that makes projects I enjoy making. When doing a project I try to do better than before. writing readable code so I'll understand when I get back to it. Before I went to Thomas More I went to VTI-Leuven. Here I was enrolled in
                industrial Sciences. At this school I had to make a GIP. This was about dams and made in dutch.
